In this repository you can find my analysis of the orbital period of exoplanets observed with the Keplero telescope.

In the repository you can find the .Rmd file used to do all the analysis and the .md file that show the results.

I thank for the help in collecting the data and correcting the text to Luca Franco, Sandrine Metzger, Giulia Scialanga, Davide Toma.
